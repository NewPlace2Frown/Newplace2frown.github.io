>Time is said to be irreversible. And this is true enough in the sense that ‘you can’t bring back the past,’ as they say.

>But what exactly is this ‘past?’ 
>Is it what has passed?

>And what does ‘passed’ mean for a person when for each of us the past is the bearer of all this is constant in the reality of the present, of each current moment? 
>In a certain sense the past is far more real, or at any rate more stable, more resilient than the present.
