## A New Place To Frown

Interested in Grandmasters, Quasars and Malkovich; in police kicking kids, the suffering of light, and the decisive moment.

With years of experience photographing for both personal and professional purposes, I have developed an intense love for this indescribable visual art form, and an insatiable drive to document the world around me.

Hailing from Lancaster, a town in the north west of England, I have documented people, places and things across the planet, from Poland to Gambia and back again; Wandering the streets of Geneva, or immersing myself in the legendary Manchester underbelly.

With an instinctive process, my work explores a wide range of subjects, primarily from the streets, whilst simultaneously exploring various other realms - from the digital to the astronomical.

From the age of 15, ever since my art teacher introduced me to Bresson's "decisive moment" at the same time as Robert Shore's "post-photography", I've been obsessively trying to capture the world in the 3:2 frame of my camera. Striding the line between traditional photojournalism, and contemporary fine art/documentary photography. 

This inherent contradiction of art, truth and beauty is core to my work, and is something I struggle with every time I shoot - I aspire to engage audiences in questioning the "truth" portrayed in my images, striving to provoke thoughtful reflection and introspection.

I hope to share this perspective with the world, and I hope you enjoy my work! Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to chat, or commission my services.
