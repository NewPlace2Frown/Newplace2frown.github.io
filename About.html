      <h2>Hi there, my name's Leon. I take photos.</h2>

      <h2>A New Place To Frown</h2>
      
      <p>Interested in Grandmasters, Quasars and Malkovich; in police kicking kids, the suffering of light, and the decisive moment.</p>

      <p>With years of experience photographing for both personal and professional purposes, I have developed an intense love for this indescribable visual art form, and an insatiable drive to document the world around me.</p>

      <p>Hailing from Lancaster, a town in the north west of England, I have documented people, places and things across the planet, from Poland to Gambia and back again; Wandering the streets of Geneva, or immersing myself in the legendary Manchester underbelly.</p>

      <p>With an instinctive process, my work explores a wide range of subjects, primarily from the streets, whilst simultaneously exploring various other realms - from the digital to the astronomical.</p>

      <p>From the age of 15, ever since my art teacher introduced me to Bresson's "decisive moment" at the same time as Robert Shore's "post-photography", I've been obsessively trying to capture the world in the 3:2 frame of my camera. Striding the line between traditional photojournalism, and contemporary fine art/documentary photography.</p>

      <p>This inherent contradiction of art, truth and beauty is core to my work, and is something I struggle with every time I shoot - I aspire to engage audiences in questioning the "truth" portrayed in my images, striving to provoke thoughtful reflection and introspection.</p>

      <p>I hope to share this perspective with the world, and I hope you enjoy my work! Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to chat, or commission my services.</p>

      <p>—Leon</p>
