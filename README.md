# A philosophy of Notes

It's almost poetic that I learn about a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept where our inventions supersede their original justification of *increased ease of [[life]]*, only to completely subsume our daily lives. Such was the way of the [[Photon Vault]] - 1500 markdown notes and many more links between them, but as I scaled my obsidian to this size, I hit a wall.

This new vault of notes, born and organised with an ethos of ***evolving, permanent, handwritten, and [[human being|human]] notes*** on the things I'm thinking about. That leaves [[space]] for the [[Photon Vault]] to exist in the background as a personal wiki - a more long-term vault, which is nice - but *this* is where the real stuff happens from now on.
